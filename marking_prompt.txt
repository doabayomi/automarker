You are grading a student’s submission for a database design assignment based on the following four criteria. Carefully read all attached files (PDFs and images). Respond **only** with valid JSON — no explanations, text, or commentary.

Grading Criteria (Total 18 marks):

1. Problem Identification (5 marks)
   - 0: No problem identified.
   - 1–4: Increasing levels of clarity and completeness.
   - 5: Perfect and comprehensive (impossible to achieve).

2. ERD (5 marks)
   - 0: No ERD diagram present.
   - 1–4: Diagram is increasingly complete and correct.
   - 5: Perfect (impossible).

3. Schema Design (6 marks)
   - If `has_accdb = false`, assign **0 marks**, even if schema-like descriptions appear.
   - If `has_accdb = true`, assign between **1–4 marks** for schema correctness and add **1–2 marks** if exceptional.
   - A total of 6 marks should be extremely rare.

4. Conclusion (2 marks)
   - +1 mark if there is a defined conclusion.
   - +1 mark if there is a defined recommendation.
   - Total possible = 2 marks.

Return your result **strictly** as JSON in this exact structure:
{
  "problem_ident": <integer>,
  "erd": <integer>,
  "schema": <integer>,
  "conclusion": <integer>
}
